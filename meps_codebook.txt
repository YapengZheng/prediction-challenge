Variable: "PSUANN"
Name:        PSUANN
Label:        Annual primary sampling unit (PSU) for variance estimation
Variable Text:        PSUANN is the annual primary sampling unit variable that represents the impact of sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use PSUANN to generate annual estimates for all years. For pooled analyses including years before 2002, analysts should instead use the pooled primary sampling unit variable, PSUPLD. For analyses limited to years 2002 and later, PSUANN is suitable for use in annual and pooled analyses.

PSUANN is constant within a sample design period and changes between sample design periods. For analysis, researchers need to use PSUANN in conjunction with STRATANN to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data.

Variable: "STRATANN"
Name:        STRATANN
Label:        Annual stratum for variance estimation
Variable Text:        STRATANN is the annual sampling strata that represents the impact of sample design stratification on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use STRATANN to generate annual estimates for all years. For pooled analyses including years before 2002, analysts should instead use the pooled variance sampling strata variable, STRATAPLD. For analyses limited to years 2002 and later, STRATANN is suitable for use in annual and pooled analyses. 

From 1996-2001, STRATANN were statistically independent from year to year. Beginning in 2002, strata are constant within sample design period. For analysis, researchers need to use STRATANN in conjunction with PSUANN to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with MEPS data.

Variable: "PSUPLD"
Name:        PSUPLD
Label:        Pooled primary sampling unit (PSU) for variance estimation
Variable Text:        PSUPLD is the pooled variance primary sampling unit variable that represents the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use PSUPLD instead of the annual primary sampling unit (PSUANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey year 2001 or earlier. When pooling data from only 2002 and later, use the variable PSUANN, the annual stratum variable for each survey year.

For analysis, researchers need to use PSUPLD in conjunction with STRATAPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data. 


PSUPLD should be used when analysts wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of PSUPLD and STRAPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.

Variable: "STRATAPLD"
Name:        STRATAPLD
Label:        Pooled variance stratum
Variable Text:        STRATAPLD is the pooled variance sampling strata variable that represents the impact of the sample design stratification on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use STRATAPLD instead of the annual strata variable (STRATANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey year 2001 or earlier. For pooling data from only 2002 and later, it is appropriate to use the variable STRATANN. 

For analysis, researchers need to use STRATAPLD in conjunction with PSUPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data.


STRATAPLD should be used when users wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of STRATAPLD and PSUPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.

Variable: "PERWEIGHT"
Name:        PERWEIGHT
Label:        Final basic annual weight
Variable Text:        PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable based on the Final Person Weight in the original MEPS annual full-year consolidated files. This weight should be used for many cross-sectional analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

Variable: "HIEU"
Name:        HIEU
Label:        Health insurance eligibility unit identifier
Variable Text:        A Health Insurance Eligibility Unit (HIEU) are sub-family relationship units constructed to include adults plus any family members who would typically be eligible for coverage under the adults' private health insurance family plans. This variable uses information from the CPS family identification variable CPSFAMID to identify family units as of the end of the calendar year. Persons missing CPSFAMID data for the final round of the calendar year are assigned family information from the last round within the year for which they do have family relationship data. HIEUs are comprised of adults, their spouses, and their unmarried natural/adoptive children age 18 and under (age 24 and under if the children are full-time students). 


Children who do not live with their natural/adoptive parents are placed in different HIEUs, as follows: Foster children always compromise a separate HIEU, unmarried children are placed in a stepparent HIEU, grandparent HIEU, great-grandparent HIEU, or aunt/uncle HIEU. Children of unmarried minors are placed (along with their minor parents) in the HIEUIDX of their adult grandparents (if possible). Married minors are placed into separate HIEUs along with any spouses and children they might have. If there is no adult family member present in the CPSFAMID, an HIEU will be headed by an unmarried minor (such as in foster children HIEUs).

Date of birth and age were asked for each reporting unit member, and then exact age was calculated from date of birth. Where the calculated age and the age provided did not match, inconsistencies were reviewed and resolved. When date of birth was not provided, but age was provided, the month and year of birth were assigned randomly from among the possible valid options. For any cases still not accounted, age was imputed using:
(1) the mean age difference between MEPS participants with certain family relationships (where available) or 
(2) the mean age value for MEPS participants.

Variable: "RELATE"

Label:        Relationship to householder
Variable Text:        RELATE reports an individual's relationship to the reference person.


For each reporting unit, the person who owns or rents the dwelling unit is usually defined as the reference person. For student reporting units, the student is defined as the reporting unit. For the reference person, the value of RELATE is "Self." For all others, the relationship is indicated by codes, such as "husband/spouse," "wife/spouse," "son," etc. 

If the relationship of an individual to the reference person was not ascertained during the Round specific interview, relationships between other RU members were used, where possible, to assign a relationship to the reference person. If two individuals' relationship indicated that they were spouses, but both had a marital status of "single," they were assigned a relationship of non-marital partners.

Variable: "YRSINUS"
Name:        YRSINUS
Label:        Number of years spent in the U.S.
Variable Text:        For individuals born outside the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, YRSINUS indicates how long such persons had been in the United States. In most cases, this information was collected via the question, "In what year did you come to the United States to stay?" If the response to this question was "refused" or "don't know," the interviewer tried to collect the information via an alternatively phrased question: "About how long have you been in the United States?" 

The data included in the public use files for YRSINUS are recodes of the responses to these questions, with each answer in the form of a calendar year converted to a number of years present. The calendar year format of the initial question would have increased the precision of responses by discouraging rounding; the recoded format (number of years present) is easier for researchers to analyze.

Variable: "FTOTINCCPS"
Name:        FTOTINCCPS
Label:        Constructed total CPS family income
Variable Text:        Available in all survey years, FTOTINCCPS is an IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable that represents the sum of total personal income (INCTOT) (excluding tax refunds and capital gains) across all members of the CPS-defined family. 

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS-defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

FTOTINCCPS was constructed by summing the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income over CPS family members, as defined by CPSFAMID, to yield CPS family-level total income. Person-level total income amounts comprised annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level, and thus family-level, income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

Beginning in 2007, the variable FTOTVAL was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT). Additionally, the IPUMS MEPS-constructed variable FTOTINCMEPS offers total family income for MEPS-defined families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). Like FTOTINCCPS, FTOTINCMEPS is constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income.

Variable: "FTOTINCMEPS"
Name:        FTOTINCMEPS
Label:        Constructed total MEPS family income
Variable Text:        Available in all survey years, FTOTINCMEPS is an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable that sums total personal income (INCTOT) (excluding tax refunds and capital gains) across the MEPS family to report the total income for each person's MEPS family.

MEPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption, fostering, or cohabitation, and residing together. Unlike the CPS defined family, MEPS family does include unmarried partners and foster children.

FTOTINCMEPS was derived by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. FTOTINCMEPS was constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income 

Person-level income totals were then summed over MEPS family members, as defined by FAMIDYR, to yield MEPS family-level total income.

Beginning in 2007, the variable FAMINC was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT). Additionally, the variable CPSFAMINCCALC is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for CPS families (excludes foster children and unmarried partners).

Name:        INCTOT
Label:        Total personal income
Variable Text:        INCTOT reports the sum of all person-level income for the current calendar year, excluding income from tax refunds and capital gains.

INCTOT includes annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation was used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for item non-response and for person in the full-year file who were not in round 3). Reported income components were generally left unedited.

Variable: "CPI2009"
Name:        CPI2009
Label:        CPI conversion factor
Variable Text:        For all persons, CPI2009 provides the Consumer Price Index multiplier (available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [URL omitted from DDI.]) to convert dollar figures to constant 2009 dollars. Multiplying dollar amounts by this variable (which is constant within years) will render them comparable across time and thus suitable for multivariate analysis.



For IPUMS MEPS, 2009 dollars represent data in 2009 as income and expenditures are asked about for the current year.

For more information on how to use CPI2009, please see the IPUMS MEPS User Notes on Consumer Price Index [URL omitted from DDI.].

Variable: "FTOTVAL"
Name:        FTOTVAL
Label:        Total family income
Variable Text:        FTOTVAL reports the total income for each person's CPS family.

Beginning in 2007, FAMINC was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT).

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

FTOTVAL was derived by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. Person-level income totals were then summed over family members, as defined by CPSFAMID, to yield CPS family-level total income.

Two additional family income variables were created by IPUMS MEPS. FTOTINCCPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for CPS families (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). FTOTINCMEPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). Both FTOTINCCPS and FTOTINCMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income)

Variable: "INCWAGE"
Name:        INCWAGE
Label:        Wage income
Variable Text:        For all persons who filed or will file a tax return (before 2002) and all persons filing tax returns as the Primary filer or who are age 16 and older (in 2002 and forward), INCWAGE reports the total income they received from wages or salary, tips, commissions, or bonuses during the current calendar year. Using the reported income information, annual income amounts were then edited and imputed for every record on the full-year file. Please refer to the data quality flag (QINCWAGE) for information about what editing methods were employed for wage and salary income amount.

If respondents needed more information about what types of income to report as wage and salary income, they were provided with the additional guidance: "This includes all income from wages, salary, commissions, and bonuses and is shown in Box 2 of the tax filer's W-2 form. Tips, scholarships, fellowship grants, and dependent care benefits should also be included."

Collection of MEPS income data

MEPS collected data about income sources and amounts primarily on the Income Section of the questionnaire, fielded during rounds 3 and 5. Additional financial data about household members' real estate, businesses, vehicles, investments, other assets, and debts was collected in the Assets Section of the questionnaire, fielded during round 5. 

Before they were asked about income sources and amounts, respondents were prompted to retrieve and refer to any "tax materials that you may have." Reported income amounts reflect the amount of income reported on annual tax returns by the person and, if applicable, the secondary filer on joint tax returns. Information is also available on what kind of tax return the person filed (FILESTATUS), whether they were the primary or secondary filer on a joint tax return FILEPRIM), whether the joint filer on a joint tax return is a member of the responding unit (FILEJOINT), and the person identifier of the secondary filer on a joint tax return (FILE2PID).

Top and Bottom-Coding of Income Data

For each income source, top codes were applied to the top percentile of all cases for the income source. This includes negative amounts that exceeded income thresholds in absolute value; for example, if the top percentile of a given income source was an absolute value of $15,000, the values of that income source would be top-coded at $15,000 and bottom-coded at -$15,000. In cases where less than one percent of all persons received an income source, all recipients of that income source were top-coded. Reported income amounts under $1 were recorded as missing.

If the business was shared, persons were instructed to include only the amount that would be considered their portion. Using the reported income information, annual income amounts were then edited and imputed for every record on the full-year file. Please refer to the data quality flag (QINCBUS) for information about what editing methods were employed for business income amount.

If respondents needed more information about what types of income to report as farm or nonfarm business income, they were provided with the additional guidance for farm business income: "Include income or loss associated with being the sole proprietor of a farm. Farm business costs and expenses are deductible from farm gross business receipts in arriving at farm net profit or loss. Gains or losses from these sources are calculated on Schedule F." For nonfarm business income, respondents were provided with the additional guidance: "Include income or loss associated with being the sole proprietor of a non-farm business, including self-employed members of a profession. Business costs and expenses are deductible from gross receipts or gross sales in arriving at net profit or loss. Compensation of the sole proprietor is taxable income and, therefore, not allowed as a business deduction in computing net income. The net gain or loss is computed on Schedule C or C-EZ."

DISABILITY 
A person who has worked long enough and recently enough to be covered can receive benefits upon becoming totally disabled, regardless of his or her age. The person must be unable to continue in his or her previous job and unable to adjust to other work; furthermore, the disability must be long-term (lasting or expected to last for at least one year or to result in death). The amount of the disability benefit payable depends on the person's age and previous earnings.

SURVIVORS' BENEFITS 
If a worker covered by Social Security dies, [the] surviving spouse or children can receive survivors' benefits. Sometimes, survivors' benefits are available to a divorced spouse. Children cannot receive survivors' benefits after age 19 unless the child was disabled before age 22."

Collection of MEPS income data

MEPS collected data about income sources and amounts primarily on the Income Section of the questionnaire, fielded during rounds 3 and 5. Additional financial data about household members' real estate, businesses, vehicles, investments, other assets, and debts was collected in the Assets Section of the questionnaire, fielded during round 5. 

Before they were asked about income sources and amounts, respondents were prompted to retrieve and refer to any "tax materials that you may have." Reported income amounts reflect the amount of income reported on annual tax returns by the person and, if applicable, the secondary filer on joint tax returns. Information is also available on what kind of tax return the person filed (FILESTATUS), whether they were the primary or secondary filer on a joint tax return FILEPRIM), whether the joint filer on a joint tax return is a member of the responding unit (FILEJOINT), and the person identifier of the secondary filer on a joint tax return (FILE2PID).

Top and Bottom-Coding of Income Data

For each income source, top codes were applied to the top percentile of all cases for the income source. This includes negative amounts that exceeded income thresholds in absolute value; for example, if the top percentile of a given income source was an absolute value of $15,000, the values of that income source would be top-coded at $15,000 and bottom-coded at -$15,000. In cases where less than one percent of all persons received an income source, all recipients of that income source were top-coded. Reported income amounts under $1 were recorded as missing.

PARTNERSHIP OR S CORPORATION 
Since partnerships and S corporations are not taxable entities, their net profit or loss is taxed, in general, directly to the members of the partnership or shareholders in the S corporation. This income includes the taxpayer's share of the ordinary gain or loss of the enterprise and certain payments made to the taxpayer for the use of capital or as a salary.

RENTAL INCOME 
Income or loss less amounts for depreciation, repairs, improvements and other allowable expenses related to the rented property.

ROYALTIES

If respondents needed more information about what kinds of income to report as Individual Retirement Account income, they were provided with the additional guidance: 

"IRA (INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT 
An Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, is a personal retirement plan whereby a limited amount of annual earnings may be invested, as in mutual funds or a savings account, with the investment money and its earnings being tax-free until retirement. Payments from these accounts must be reported on the tax filer's income tax return.

Payments include regular distributions, early distributions, rollovers, and any other money or property the person received from his/her IRA account or annuity. These amounts can be found on form 1099-R.

KEOGH ACCOUNT 
A retirement plan for self-employed persons and certain groups of employees whereby a limited amount of annual earnings may be invested, as in mutual funds or a savings account, with the invested money and its earnings being tax-free until retirement. These amounts can be found on form 1099-R.

401K 
A 401(k) is an optional retirement plan supported by many companies. This money is taken out and invested before the employee's paycheck is taxed. The plan is set up by a qualified employer with the primary contributions being deposited by the employee. Often there is a company matching plan where they will also contribute a percentage of the money the employee contributed. While the 401(k) continues to grow, taxes will not be paid on it. When the employee withdraws the money at retirement, he/she will be taxed on the amount in the account. There is a penalty to remove the money prior to retirement age; however, many plans allow the employee to borrow money using the plan as collateral or remove the money without penalty in certain emergencies. These amounts can be found on from 1099-R."

Variable Text:        For all persons who filed or will file a tax return (before 2002) and all persons filing tax returns as the Primary filer and who have filed or will file a 1040A Long Form, another type of form, or refused/don't know what type of form they completed or who were age 16 and older (in 2002 and forward), INCOTH reports the total income they received from a source other than wages and salary; farm income (or loss); business income (or loss); Social Security/Railroad Retirement; Private, military, or government pensions; interest; dividends; or rental income (or loss) during the current calendar year. Using the reported income information, annual income amounts were then edited and imputed for every record on the full-year file. Please refer to the data quality flag (QINCOTH) for information about what editing methods were employed for other source of income amount.

If respondents needed more information about what types of income to report as other source of income, they were shown an interview card that listed each of the eight different income sources that MEPS specifically collected information about in the interview.

Collection of MEPS income data

MEPS collected data about income sources and amounts primarily on the Income Section of the questionnaire, fielded during rounds 3 and 5. Additional financial data about household members' real estate, businesses, vehicles, investments, other assets, and debts was collected in the Assets Section of the questionnaire, fielded during round 5. 

Before they were asked about income sources and amounts, respondents were prompted to retrieve and refer to any "tax materials that you may have." Reported income amounts reflect the amount of income reported on annual tax returns by the person and, if applicable, the secondary filer on joint tax returns. Information is also available on what kind of tax return the person filed (FILESTATUS), whether they were the primary or secondary filer on a joint tax return FILEPRIM), whether the joint filer on a joint tax return is a member of the responding unit (FILEJOINT), and the person identifier of the secondary filer on a joint tax return (FILE2PID).

Top and Bottom-Coding of Income Data

For each income source, top codes were applied to the top percentile of all cases for the income source. This includes negative amounts that exceeded income thresholds in absolute value; for example, if the top percentile of a given income source was an absolute value of $15,000, the values of that income source would be top-coded at $15,000 and bottom-coded at -$15,000. In cases where less than one percent of all persons received an income source, all recipients of that income source were top-coded. Reported income amounts under $1 were recorded as missing.

Variable: "POVCAT"
Name:        POVCAT
Label:        CPS family income as a percentage of the poverty line, original data, categorical
Variable Text:        POVCAT is a categorical variable reporting family income as a percentage of the poverty line.

POVCAT uses family income and CPS family size. CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income is constructed using person-level total income, comprised of: annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workman's compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total. POVCAT is constructed by dividing family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition), with the resulting percentages grouped into the following 5 categories: 
1. Negative or poor (LT 100% poverty line) 
2. Near poor (100-124% poverty line) 
3. Low income (125-199% poverty line 
4. Middle income (200-399% poverty line) 
5. High income (GE 400% poverty line)

Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVCAT.

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation were used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for non-response and for persons in the full-year file who were not in the round where income questions were asked). Round-level data on employment status, hours worked, and wages were used to supplement earnings data collected in the Income Section. 

A continuous variable POVLEV for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available beginning in 2007. An IPUMS MEPS constructed variable (POVCATCPS) offers CPS family income to poverty level ratio data in more detailed categories, for all survey years. POVLEV and POVCPSCAT calculate family income to poverty level ratios for the CPS family (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). Additionally, an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable (POVCATMEPS) is available for all survey years, and contains more detailed poverty line ratio categories for MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATCPS and POVCATMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income (summed across MEPS family), and therefore may not match POVCAT.

Label:        Family income as a percentage of the poverty line, continuous
Variable Text:        POVLEV is a continuous measure of the ratio of total family income (excluding capital gains and tax refunds) to the federal poverty line. MEPS staff constructed POVLEV primarily from data collected in the Income section of the MEPS questionnaire, by dividing CPS family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition). 

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total. Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVLEV.

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation were used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for non-response and for persons in the full-year file who were not in the round where income questions were asked). Round-level data on employment status, hours worked, and wages were used to supplement earnings data collected in the Income Section. 

A categorical variable POVCAT for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available in all survey years. Two categorical IPUMS MEPS constructed variables are also available. (POVCATCPS) and (POVCATMEPS) offer family income to poverty level ratio data in more detailed categories, for all survey years. POVCAT and POVCPSCAT calculate family income to poverty level ratios for the CPS family (excludes foster children and unmarried partners).

Label:        CPS family income as a percentage of the poverty line, IPUMS MEPS constructed, categorical
Variable Text:        POVCATCPS is an IPUMS MEPS constructed, categorical variable for family income as a percentage of the poverty line, using the CPS definition of family. CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Total family income is constructed using person-level total income, comprised of: annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workman's compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Total individual income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

To construct POVCATCPS, total individual income amounts were first summed across members of the CPS family (defined by CPSFAMID) to yield a CPS family income total. The total CPS family income amount was then divided by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition), with the resulting percentages grouped into fourteen categories.

Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVCATCPS. POVCATCPS was constructed using publicly available total individual income, which has been edited and top-coded. Due to this editing of the income data, POVCATCPS may not always match what is reported in the MEPS poverty variables.

A continuous variable POVLEV for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available beginning in 2007. A categorical variable POVCAT is available for all survey years, and is constructed from income data that has not been top-coded, however, it offers less detailed poverty ratio categories.

Variable Text:        POVCATMEPS is an IPUMS MEPS constructed, categorical variable for total family income for MEPS-defined families as a percentage of the poverty line. MEPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption, foster care, or cohabitation and residing together. Unlike the CPS-defined family, MEPS family does include unmarried partners and foster children.

Total family income is constructed using person-level total income, comprised of: annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workman's compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Total individual income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. 

To construct POVCATMEPS, total individual income was summed across members of the MEPS family (defined by FAMIDYR) to yield a MEPS family income total. Total MEPS family income was then divided by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition), with the resulting percentages grouped into fourteen categories.

Persons missing FAMIDYR were treated as one-person families in constructing POVCATMEPS.

Definitions

Family respondents were asked about public assistance, Medicaid, or SCHIP coverage during the Health Insurance portion of the questionnaire. Respondents were asked "Let's talk (again) about all the health insurance coverage the family may have to help pay for the costs of medical care (since {START DATE}/between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}." Respondents were prompted to retrieve any insurance cards or identifying information to help answer questions about health insurance coverage. 

Respondents were asked "{Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME} are state programs that pay for health care for persons in need. People covered by {Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME} may have a (piece of paper/card) that looks something like this.

At any time {since {START DATE}/between {START DATE} and {END DATE}}, has anyone in the family been covered by {Medicaid/{STATE NAME FOR MEDICAID}} or {STATE CHIP NAME}?" If respondents needed more explanation of Medicaid or SCHIP, they were told:

"Medicaid is a federally-assisted, state-administered program that offers health benefits to low income persons on public assistance. The program also may cover the aged, the blind, and the disabled who are in financial need. Medicaid may be known by different names in different states.

The Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a program which gives each state permission to offer health insurance for children, up to age 19, who are not already insured and for uninsured families with limited income and resources who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP is a state administered program and may be known by different names in different states."

Detail about Insurance Editing 

In Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5, insurance that was in effect at the previous round's interview date was reviewed with the respondent. Most of the insurance variables have been logically edited to address issues that arose during such reviews in Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5. Edits address issues of missing data on the time period of coverage that was either reviewed or initially reported in a given round.

Detail about Insurance Editing

In Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5, insurance that was in effect at the previous round's interview date was reviewed with the respondent. Most of the insurance variables have been logically edited to address issues that arose during such reviews in Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5. Edits address issues of missing data on the time period of coverage that was either reviewed or initially reported in a given round.

Variable Text:        For all persons, PUBMMX is a set of constructed monthly summary health insurance variables indicating whether they have any public health insurance in a given calendar month. Persons identified as covered by public insurance are those reporting coverage under TRICARE (TRIMMX), Medicare (MCRMMX), Medicaid or SCHIP (MCDMMX), or other public hospital/physician programs (OPAMM and OPBMM). Persons covered only by state-specific programs that did not provide comprehensive coverage (STAMM) were not considered to have public coverage when constructing the PUBMMX variables. By adding PUBMMX to your data cart, you are in effect adding 12 monthly health insurance coverage variables (PUBJAX-PUBDEX), one variable for each calendar month.

Detail about Insurance Editing

Beginning in Panel 18 Round 3/Panel 19 Round 1 (calendar year 2014), information was collected on whether respondents obtained health insurance through a federal or state health insurance exchange. Additionally, respondents reporting insurance from a group, directly from an insurance company or HMO, from an insurance agent, or from an "other" unspecified source were asked "Is this coverage through {state exchange name}?" 

Persons who reported a source of insurance that was not through an exchange/marketplace (e.g. through a group or directly from an insurance company) but who answered yes when asked if the coverage was through the state-specific exchange were also classified as having exchange/marketplace coverage instead of being assigned to the category they originally reported. In addition to reporting coverage through an exchange/marketplace, coverage needed to have been identified as hospital/physician coverage, but not identified as having Medicare supplemental coverage.

MEPS respondents reporting public coverage were also asked whether the public coverage was obtained through a federal or state marketplace in case respondents were confused about whether the source of coverage was public or private. This approach is consistent with the health insurance questions in the Current Population Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. These variables should be considered unedited since some individuals with public coverage reported as through a marketplace may be edited to private exchange/marketplace coverage in later releases of MEPS data, once additional information on family income is available to aid in data edits.

In Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5, insurance that was in effect at the previous round's interview date was reviewed with the respondent. Most of the insurance variables have been logically edited to address issues that arose during such reviews in Rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5. Edits address issues of missing data on the time period of coverage that was either reviewed or initially reported in a given round.

Variable: "OPAMM"
Name:        OPAMM
Label:        Monthly other public hospital/physician managed health insurance coverage
Variable Text:        For all persons, OPAMM is a set of constructed monthly health insurance variables indicating whether they have other public hospital/physician managed care and paid something for the coverage in a given calendar month. By adding OPAMM to your data cart, you are in effect adding 12 monthly health insurance coverage variables (OPAJA-OPADE), one variable for each calendar month.

The OPAMM variables are provided only to assist in editing and should not be used to make separate insurance estimates for these types of insurance categories. Questions about other public hospital/physician coverage were asked in an attempt to identify Medicaid or SCHIP recipients who may not have recognized their coverage as such. These questions were asked only if a respondent did not report Medicaid or SCHIP directly. Respondents reporting other hospital/physician coverage were asked follow-up questions to determine if the coverage was through a specific Medicaid HMO or if it included some other managed care characteristics. Respondents who identified managed care from either path were asked if the recipient paid anything for the coverage and/or if a government source paid for the coverage.

Label:        Monthly other public hospital/physician non-nanaged health insurance coverage
Variable Text:        For all persons, OPBMM is a set of constructed monthly health insurance variables indicating whether they have other public hospital/physician non-managed care in a given calendar month. By adding OPBMM to your data cart, you are in effect adding 12 monthly health insurance coverage variables (OPBJA-OPBDE), one variable for each calendar month.

The OPBMM variables are provided only to assist in editing and should not be used to make separate insurance estimates for these types of insurance categories. Questions about other public hospital/physician coverage were asked in an attempt to identify Medicaid or SCHIP recipients who may not have recognized their coverage as such. These questions were asked only if a respondent did not report Medicaid or SCHIP directly. Respondents reporting other hospital/physician coverage were asked follow-up questions to determine if the coverage was through a specific Medicaid HMO or if it included some other managed care characteristics. Respondents who identified managed care from either path were asked if the recipient paid anything for the coverage and/or if a government source paid for the coverage.

Variable Text:        ANYLMT summarizes whether a person has any IADL, ADL, functional, or activity limitations. ANYLMT is constructed by AHRQ staff based on round-level information. The rounds in which information about limitations is collected changes over time, as noted in more detail under the Comparability tab.

ANYLMT is constructed from round-level component variables (not currently available in IPUMS MEPS) measuring IADLs, ADLs, work limitations, and activity limitations (in all years), and limitations in seeing and/or hearing (in years before 2013). If any of these components were coded "Yes," then ANYLMT is coded as "Yes." If all components were coded "No," then ANYLMT is coded as "No." If all components were coded as "Inapplicable" (Not in Universe), then ANYLMT was also coded as "Not in Universe." If some components were coded as "No" and others had missing value codes, ANYLMT was coded as "Not ascertained."

Label:        Ever told had ADHD/ADD
Variable Text:        ADDEV identifies children age 5-17 who have ever been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD). Respondents were asked if they have ever been told "by a doctor or other professional that (PERSON) had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)?"


Beginning in Panel 12, ADDEV was included as a Priority Condition in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Rounds 2 and 4 for only new reporting unit members. In Rounds 3 and 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round; the joint pain and chronic bronchitis questions were asked in Rounds 3 and 5 for all current or institutionalized persons aged 18 or older, regardless of Round 1, Round 2, and Round 4 responses. The conditions included in the PE section are:
High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses 
Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and other unspecified heart disease) 
Stroke 
Emphysema 
Chronic Bronchitis 
High cholesterol, including the age of diagnosis 
Cancer 
Diabetes 
Joint pain 
Arthritis 
Asthma 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD) 
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high prevalence, and because generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed.

Beginning with Panel 12, condition data were collected at the person-by-round level (indicating if the person was ever diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person-by-round variable was set to '1' (Yes) and a condition record for that medical condition was created.

Variable: "STROKEV"
Name:        STROKEV
Label:        Ever told had a stroke
Variable Text:        STROKEV identifies persons over age 17 who have had a stroke. Respondents were asked if they have ever been told "by a doctor or other health professional that (PERSON) had a stroke or TIA? A TIA is a transient ischemic attack which is sometimes referred to as a ministroke"


Beginning in Panel 12, STROKEV was included as a Priority Condition in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Rounds 2 and 4 for only new reporting unit members. In Rounds 3 and 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round; the joint pain and chronic bronchitis questions were asked in Rounds 3 and 5 for all current or institutionalized persons aged 18 or older, regardless of Round 1, Round 2, and Round 4 responses. The conditions included in the PE section are:
High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses 
Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and other unspecified heart disease) 
Stroke 
Emphysema 
Chronic Bronchitis 
High cholesterol, including the age of diagnosis 
Cancer 
Diabetes 
Joint pain 
Arthritis 
Asthma 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD) 
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high prevalence, and because generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed.

Beginning with Panel 12, condition data were collected at the person-by-round level (indicating if the person was ever diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person-by-round variable was set to '1' (Yes) and a condition record for that medical condition was created.

Variable: "HYP2TIME"
Name:        HYP2TIME
Label:        Ever told had hypertension on 2+ visits
Variable Text:        For sample persons or adults aged 18 and over who were ever told they had hypertension or high blood pressure, HYP2TIME reports if they were told they had high blood pressure or hypertension on two or more DIFFERENT visits. 




Beginning in Panel 12, HYP2TIME was included as a Priority Condition in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Rounds 2 and 4 for only new reporting unit members. In Rounds 3 and 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round; the joint pain and chronic bronchitis questions were asked in Rounds 3 and 5 for all current or institutionalized persons aged 18 or older, regardless of Round 1, Round 2, and Round 4 responses. The conditions included in the PE section are:
•        High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses 
•        Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and other unspecified heart disease) 
•        Stroke 
•        Emphysema 
•        Chronic Bronchitis 
•        High cholesterol, including the age of diagnosis 
•        Cancer 
•        Diabetes 
•        Joint pain 
•        Arthritis 
•        Asthma 
•        Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD) 
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high prevalence, and because generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed.

Beginning with Panel 12, condition data were collected at the person-by-round level (indicating if the person was ever diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person-by-round variable was set to "1" (Yes) and a condition record for that medical condition was created.

Variable: "AEFFORT"

Label:        Felt everything an effort, past 30 days (adults)
Variable Text:        AEFFORT reports responses to the question, "During the past 30 days, how often did you feel that everything was an effort?" 


Related Variables

AEFFORT is one of a series of six variables whose responses can be summed as a scale measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period. This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress. 


Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)
Nervous? (ANERVOUS)
Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)
Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)
That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)
Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)

As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time." 


Scoring Variables

Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of the six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time"). The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress. According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.


The summed score is reported in K6SUM.

For a small proportion of sample persons, the sum of the physician and non-physician visit variables is less than the total number of office-based visits because OBTOTVIS contains reported visits where the respondent did not know the type of provider.

Related variables 
Summary variables related to the total number of office-based medical encounters are also available broken down by the type of medical provider seen, including physicians (OBPHVIS), non-physicians (OBNPHVIS), chiropractors (OBCHIVIS), nurse practitioners (OBNPVIS), optometrists (OBOPTVIS), physician assistants (OBPAVIS), and physical or occupational therapists (OBTHVIS).

These are encounters that took place primarily in emergency room settings and clinics, and include visits to both physician and non-physician providers.

Label:        Annual total charges for health care from emergency room visits
Variable Text:        For all persons, ERCHGTOT captures the sum of fully established charges for care received from emergency room medical providers during the year. This includes charges for hospital facility expenses (including direct hospital care, including room and board, diagnostic and laboratory work, x-rays, and similar charges, as well as any physician services included in the hospital charge) and "separately billing doctor" or SBD charges (including services provided to patients in hospital settings by providers like radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists, whose charges are often not included in hospital bills). This variable does not usually reflect actual payments made for services, which can be substantially lower due to factors such as negotiated discounts, bad debt, and free care. For more information on how MEPS collects expenditure and charge data, please refer to our user note on medical expenditures [URL omitted from DDI.].


Note that hospitals usually include expenses associated with emergency room visits that immediately result in an inpatient stay with the charges and payments for the inpatient stay. Therefore, to avoid the potential for double counting when imputing missing expenses, separately reported facility expenditures for emergency room visits that were identified in the Medical Provider Component (MPC) as directly linked to an inpatient stay were included as part of the inpatient stay only (see HPCHGTOT and HPFCHT). This strategy to avoid double counting resulted in $0 facility expenditures for these emergency room visits (but there still may be associated separately-billing doctor expenses). However, these $0 emergency room visits are still counted as separate visits in the utilization variable ERVISTOT.

For more information on how MEPS collects expenditure and charge data, please refer to our user note on medical expenditures [URL omitted from DDI.].


Some analysts may prefer to exclude "zero-night stays" from inpatient analyses and/or count these stays as ambulatory visits. Therefore, a separate variable is provided that contains a count of the number of inpatient events where the reported dates of admission and discharge were the same (ZNTOTVIS). In addition, separate expenditure variables are provided for zero-night facility expenses (ZNFEXT) and for separately billing doctor expenses (ZNPREXT). Analysts who choose to exclude the zero-night stays from inpatient expenditure analyses need to subtract the zero-night expenditure variable from the corresponding expenditure variable for total inpatient stays.

Variable: "HHDAYS"
Name:        HHDAYS
Label:        Annual total of days received visits from paid/unpaid home health care providers
Variable Text:        For all persons, HHDAYS captures the annual sum total of days they received visits from paid or unpaid home health care providers. These visits include those made by paid care providers from agencies, hospitals, or nursing homes; self-employed paid care providers; and unpaid, informal caregivers. 


Information on home health care utilization is collected on a monthly basis, in contrast to information about other types of health care utilization. The number of provider days represents the sum across months of the number of days on which home health care was received, with days summed across all providers seen. For example, if a person received care in one month from one provider on two different days, then the number of provider days would equal two. The number of provider days would also equal two if a person received care from two different providers on the same day. However, if a person received care from one provider two times on the same day, then the provider days would equal one. These variables were assigned missing values if the number of provider days could not be computed for any month in which the specific type of home health care was received.

Due to the data collection methodology, it was not possible to determine whether vision items that were reported in Round 3 had been purchased in the first or second year of the longitudinal panel. Therefore, expenses reported in Round 3 were only included in the annual file for a given year if more than half of the person's reference period for the round took place in that year.

Analysis of SF-12 data relies on two summary scores: the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS). Each summary variable includes all 12 items, but weights different items more heavily. 

The PCS puts more emphasis on:

During a typical day, limitations in moderate activities (ADDAYA)
During a typical day, limitations in climbing several flights of stairs (ADCLIM)
During past 4 weeks, pain interfered with normal work outside the home and housework (ADPAIN)
During past 4 weeks, as result of physical health, accomplished less than would like (ADPALS)
During past 4 weeks, as result of physical health, limited in kind of work or other activities (ADPWLM)

The MCS puts more emphasis on:

During the past 4 weeks, felt downhearted and blue (ADDOWN)
During the past 4 weeks, felt calm and peaceful (ADCAPE)
During the past 4 weeks, as a result of mental problems, accomplished less than you would like (ADMALS)
During the past 4 weeks, as a result of mental problems, limited in kind of work or other activities (ADMWLM)
During the past 4 weeks, physical health or emotional problems interfered with social activities (ADSOCA)

If any SF-12 component item is missing, PCS cannot be computed directly, though a proprietary method for computing the scores is available from QualityMetric, Inc. Scores are calculated according to the standard algorithm and incorporate imputations for some cases with missing data; negative values are possible in rare cases. The variable SFFLAG indicates if the scores were imputed; though cases were not imputed if too much of the component information was missing.

Changes in Comparability for the SF-12: 2000-2002 vs. 2003 and later years


Comparability of the raw scores between 2000-2002 and 2003 and later years is affected by a change to using SF-12 version 2 in 2003 from using SF-12 version 1 in earlier years. The PCS and MCS scores based on Version 1 of the SF-12 in these three years were based on norms from 1990, whereas SF-12 version 2 scores based on Version 2 of the SF-12 were based on norms from a 1998 national study.

To appropriately compare Version 1 with Version 2 scores, Version 1 scores need to be rescaled to 1998 norms. This can be done by adding 1.07897 to PCS scores from Version 1, and by subtracting 0.16934 from Version 1 MCS scores.

Variable: "K6SUM"
Name:        K6SUM
Label:        K6 score for nonspecific psychological distress: last 30 days
Variable Text:        For persons eligible for the self-administered questionnaire (SAQELIG), K6SUM is the summed scale value measuring nonspecific psychological distress over a 30-day recall period. This scale, developed by Ronald C. Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.

Kessler recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of the six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time"). The range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress. According to the scoring criteria proposed by Kessler, persons with a score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental illness.

Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:

So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)
Nervous? (ANERVOUS)
Restless or fidgety? (ARESTLESS)
Hopeless? (AHOPELESS)
That everything was an effort? (AEFFORT)
Worthless? (AWORTHLESS)

As noted above, acceptable responses fell into five categories, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."

Variable: "PHQ2"
Name:        PHQ2
Label:        PHQ-2 depression screen summary score
Variable Text:        For persons eligible for the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQELIG), PHQ2 reports the person's summary score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), a screening measure for depression. The score reported in PHQ2, ranging from 0 through 6, summarizes responses to two component variables: 

ADINTR: during the past two weeks, bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things, and 

2) ADDPRS: during the past two weeks, bothered by feeling down, 
depressed, or hopeless. 

The higher the value on PHQ2, the greater the person's tendency towards depression is. Kroenke et al. (2003) suggest a score of 3 as the optimal cut point for depression screening purposes. For more information, refer to
